# BHOPAL-METRO-ROUTE-PROJECT
# ABSTRACT 
This project is designed to optimize metro routes for the Bhopal city metro system. The program computes the shortest path between metro stations using Dijkstra's algorithm. It allows users to find optimal routes and get station connectivity information based on predefined station names and their connections.

# FEATURES
Shortest Path Calculation: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest route between two metro stations.
Station Connectivity: Displays all available metro stations and their connections.
Destination Distance Calculation: Calculates the minimum number of stations between the source and destination stations.
Efficient Data Structures: Uses graph-based data structures like lists, arrays, and priority queues for efficient computation.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Real-time Data Integration: Integrate real-time metro schedules or traffic data.
Graphical Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the metro routes and stations.
More Algorithms: Add other pathfinding algorithms like A* for route optimization.
